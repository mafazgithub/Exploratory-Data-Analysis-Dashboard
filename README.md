# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Dashboard

This project involves performing exploratory data analysis on a dataset, generating summary statistics, and creating visualizations such as pair plots and correlation heatmaps. The Python script (data_analysis_dashboard.py) uses libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to provide insights into the underlying patterns and relationships within the data.
